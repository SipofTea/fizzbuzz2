# fizzbuzz2
Created as part of a pairing session to create a fizzbuzz solution using Test Driven Development.
The program has no user input and does not return anything, it simply lets test run on it using rspec.

Co-created with [Brett Karlson](https://github.com/BrettKarlson) 
# How to use

From ./fizzbuzz2
``` shell 
rspec
```
